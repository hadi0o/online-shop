### Basic Routing Structure

- `/cart`: Shopping cart component
- `/checkout`: Checkout component
- `/profile`: User profile component
- `/login`: Login component
- `/register`: Register component
- `/admin`: Admin dashboard component

### Additional Considerations

- **State Management**: Consider using NgRx for state management if your application becomes complex.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure your components are responsive to work well on different devices.
- **Security**: Implement security measures such as input validation, secure authentication, and authorization checks.

### Development Tools

- **Angular CLI**: For scaffolding and managing the Angular project.
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe code.
- **RxJS**: For handling asynchronous operations.
- **SCSS/CSS**: For styling the components.

By planning and implementing these components and services, you can create a robust and scalable online shop application with Angular.
